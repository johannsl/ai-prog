Goal: 
    >Separate the code into a core and a exercice specific part. 
    >The core should contain the basic general A* algorithm, while the specific part should contain the GUI, the input manager, and the exercice specifics. 
    >The input dialogue can be run in command line, but each shortest path problem should be run in a GUI window. 
    >The window could have buttons for best-first, depth-first, and breadth-first; And when all of these have run, comparisons should be printed in the terminal. 
    >The GUI should use squares, circles, and three colors pluss black and white.

Problems: 
    >How does the A* core communicate with the GUI? 
    >How general should the A* core be?
